A basic tool to mass convert .cls files to .twin files, which can then be imported to twinBASIC. Adds `Class ... End Class` syntax and optionally adds randomly generated GUIDs.

Requires Windows Development Library for twinBASIC. If you don't have it, References->Available packages. If you uncheck Embed it will subsequently be available to all projects that have it linked like this one.
